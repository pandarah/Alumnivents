// You guys don't need to do this part, this is just in case you wanna make 
// your own project some day

Starting a project:
1 - Make a new project in Github
	- Turn readme on
2 - Copy the project link from the "clone or download" tab
	- Link for our project: https://github.com/NatColeKing/TrivialPursuit.git
3 - In GitBash, type the following commands
	cd */to project directory*/
	git init
	   // initializes the local directory as a git repository
	git add .
	   // adds files in repository
	git commit -m "First commit"
	   // commits the files you added so you can push
	git remote add origin https://github.com/NatColeKing/TrivialPursuit.git
	   // sets the new remote
	git remote -v
	   // you don't have to do this - this just verifies that the
	   // last command worked
	git push origin master
4 - On Github, you should see all the folders in the project and 
    "First commit"
